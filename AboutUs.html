<h1> About Cossie Play!</h1>

<p>CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes.
 Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features
 like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks
 and cost between $10 and $10,000.
We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available) as well.
